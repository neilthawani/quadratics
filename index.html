      You might see many examples of quadratic equations &quot;in the wild.&quot;
    </span>

    <span class="sentence">
      Here, we find ourselves as accidental bird-watchers. These particular birds are limited, though, by an overpowering desire to evolve into slingshot fodder.
    </span>

    <span class="sentence">
      Experiment with the slingshot below and see how far you can make these birds fly.
    </span>

    <!-- imagine we're working on a course with quadratic equations
    slingshot - pull and the slingshot follows a trajectory
    build a quick prototype - don't worry about the graphics - circle/square the bird, line as the slingshot
    event and gesture handling - how do you detect the pull gesture
    how do you animate things flying through the air
    how do you render graphics - canvas, svg, d3
    use react, angular, etc if you want
    you can use the mathigon libraries
    fermat or the other -->

    <!-- slingshot - two states: initial and pulled
    initial state is upright slingshot
    pulled state sets bird to "isDragging"
    Draggable interface on bird
    bird's trajectory is traced with dots along a coordinate plane -->
