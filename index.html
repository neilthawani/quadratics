      You might see many examples of quadratic equations &quot;in the wild.&quot;

      Here, we find ourselves as accidental bird-watchers. These particular birds are limited, though, by an overpowering desire to evolve into slingshot fodder.
    </span>

    <span class="sentence">
      Experiment with the slingshot below and see how far you can make these birds fly.

Pull back on slingshot.
Dynamically draw line between x,y point on slingshot and mouse point.
Draw dotted-line curve from mouse to estimated landing point.
When user stops holding onto bird-ball, send bird along bezier curve to landing point.

<!-- imagine we're working on a course with quadratic equations
slingshot - pull and the slingshot follows a trajectory
build a quick prototype - don't worry about the graphics - circle/square the bird, line as the slingshot
event and gesture handling - how do you detect the pull gesture
how do you animate things flying through the air
how do you render graphics - canvas, svg, d3
use react, angular, etc if you want
you can use the mathigon libraries
fermat or the other -->

<!-- slingshot - two states: initial and pulled
initial state is upright slingshot
pulled state sets bird to "isDragging"
Draggable interface on bird
bird's trajectory is traced with dots along a coordinate plane -->
